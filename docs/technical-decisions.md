## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework: React with TypeScript
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite for build tooling  
**Rationale**: 
- Complex UI requirements for dashboard, job filtering, and application management
- Large ecosystem for component libraries and integrations
- TypeScript provides type safety for API integrations
- Vite offers fast development experience

**Alternatives Considered**: Vue.js, Angular
**Trade-offs**: React learning curve, but team familiarity and ecosystem win

### Backend Framework: Python FastAPI
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI framework  
**Rationale**:
- Excellent ML/NLP library ecosystem (spaCy, transformers, OpenAI)
- FastAPI provides async support crucial for web scraping
- Strong typing with Pydantic models
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Native async/await for concurrent job processing

**Alternatives Considered**: Node.js/Express, Django, Go
**Trade-offs**: Python GIL limitations, but async framework and ML ecosystem outweigh

### Database: PostgreSQL with Redis
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: PostgreSQL 15+ as primary database, Redis for caching/queues  
**Rationale**:
- Complex relational data (users, jobs, applications, skills)
- JSON support for flexible job posting data
- Full-text search capabilities
- ACID compliance for critical application data
- Redis for session management and task queues

**Alternatives Considered**: MongoDB, MySQL + Redis
**Trade-offs**: PostgreSQL complexity vs reliability and feature richness

### Web Automation: Playwright
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: Playwright for browser automation  
**Rationale**:
- Modern anti-detection capabilities
- Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Built-in waiting and retry mechanisms
- Headless and headed modes for debugging
- Better handling of modern SPAs

**Alternatives Considered**: Selenium, Puppeteer
**Trade-offs**: Newer tool but superior for modern web apps

### ML/NLP Stack: Hybrid Approach
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: spaCy + sentence-transformers + OpenAI API  
**Rationale**:
- spaCy for text processing and entity extraction
- sentence-transformers for semantic similarity matching
- OpenAI API for cover letter generation and content creation
- Local models for speed, cloud for quality

**Alternatives Considered**: All OpenAI, Hugging Face only, spaCy only
**Trade-offs**: Cost vs quality vs speed - hybrid provides best balance

### Task Queue: Celery with Redis
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: Celery distributed task queue with Redis broker  
**Rationale**:
- Handle long-running job discovery and application tasks
- Reliable retry mechanisms for failed automation
- Horizontal scaling of workers
- Python ecosystem integration

**Alternatives Considered**: RQ, AWS SQS, Google Cloud Tasks
**Trade-offs**: Celery complexity vs feature richness for async processing

### Deployment: Docker on AWS
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: Docker containers deployed on AWS ECS/Fargate  
**Rationale**:
- Containerized microservices for independent scaling
- AWS ECS for orchestration without Kubernetes complexity
- RDS PostgreSQL for managed database
- ElastiCache Redis for managed caching
- S3 for file storage (resumes, generated documents)

**Alternatives Considered**: Kubernetes, Railway, Vercel
**Trade-offs**: AWS complexity vs enterprise-grade reliability and scaling

## Architectural Decisions

### Architecture Pattern: Event-Driven Microservices
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: Event-driven microservices with async communication  
**Services Identified**:
- User Management Service
- Job Discovery Service  
- Resume Processing Service
- Cover Letter Generation Service
- Application Automation Service
- Notification Service
- Analytics Service

**Rationale**: Independent scaling, fault isolation, technology diversity where needed

### API Design: RESTful with GraphQL for Complex Queries
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: REST APIs for CRUD operations, GraphQL for dashboard queries  
**Rationale**: REST simplicity for most operations, GraphQL efficiency for complex dashboard data

### Authentication: JWT with OAuth2
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: JWT tokens with OAuth2 for third-party platform integration  
**Rationale**: Stateless authentication, secure third-party integration

---

## Security Decisions

### Data Encryption: End-to-End
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit  
**Implementation**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for transit, field-level encryption for PII

### Credential Management: AWS Secrets Manager
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: AWS Secrets Manager for API keys and database credentials  
**Rationale**: Centralized secret management, automatic rotation, audit trails

---

## Development Decisions

### Code Organization: Feature-Based Monorepo
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: Monorepo with feature-based organization  
**Structure**:
```
/apps
  /web-frontend          # React app
  /api-gateway          # FastAPI gateway
/services
  /job-discovery        # Job scraping service
  /resume-processor     # Resume processing service
  /cover-letter-gen     # Cover letter service
  /automation-engine    # Browser automation
/packages
  /shared-types         # TypeScript types
  /ui-components        # React components
  /python-shared        # Python utilities
```

### Testing Strategy: Pyramid Approach
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: Unit tests (70%), Integration tests (20%), E2E tests (10%)  
**Tools**: pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript, Playwright for E2E

### CI/CD: GitHub Actions
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Decision**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
