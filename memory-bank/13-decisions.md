**Neutral:**
- Need to optimize vector index parameters for dataset size
- Regular index maintenance and performance tuning required
- May need to evaluate specialized vector databases at scale

### Implementation Notes
- Use cosine distance for similarity calculations: `ORDER BY embedding <=> query_vector`
- Set `ivfflat.probes = 10` for balance between speed and accuracy
- Create separate indexes for different types of embeddings (job, user profile, skills)
- Monitor query performance and adjust index lists parameter based on data volume
