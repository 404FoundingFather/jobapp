# Memory Bank Index

## Overview
This Memory Bank serves as the persistent memory system for the Job Application Assistance System project. It maintains continuity across AI sessions by documenting all crucial project information, patterns, and decisions for this specific job application assistance platform.

## Purpose
The Memory Bank is designed to overcome the challenge of AI memory resets between sessions. Each file contains essential project knowledge that allows any AI to quickly understand and continue development work effectively on the Job Application Assistance System.
